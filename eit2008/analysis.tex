The BetterXML framework allows programmers to focus on their domain
objects, and the decoupling of input and output formats from the
object tree interface via an internal event stream provides room for
future growth if necessary.  Though not suited for all uses,
NaturalXML is ideal for ad-hoc data formats, and XElement performs
well whenever a DOM-like tree is desired.  In addition, XIR provides a
record-oriented representation of XML documents for efficient
streaming and other forms of data exchange. We hope this work
represents a useful step forward in the processing of markup.

The Java reference implementation of BetterXML, including the examples
shown in this paper, is available as an open-source project through
Google Code at http://code.google.com/p/betterxml
